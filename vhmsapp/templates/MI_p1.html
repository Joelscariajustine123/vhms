    <h2>First aid tips for pet owners</h2>
    <p>Do you know what you would do if your dog ate some chocolate? What if your cat had a seizure? What if your pet was overheating on a hot summer day, or fell down the stairs and started limping?</p>

    <p>Knowing some basic first aid information and being prepared for emergencies can help you avoid the feelings of panic that may accompany these situations. First aid care is not a substitute for veterinary care, but it may save your pet’s life until you can get them veterinary care. In case of an emergency, call your veterinarian or local veterinary emergency hospital so they can be ready when you arrive.</p>

    <p>For your safety:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid any attempt to hug an injured pet.</li>
      <li>Keep your face away from your pet’s mouth.</li>
      <li>Apply a muzzle if your pet threatens to bite.</li>
      <li>Whenever possible, ask other people to help you move your pet.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Poisoning is a pet emergency that causes a great deal of confusion for pet owners. In general, any products that are harmful for people are also harmful for pets. Examples include cleaning products, rodent poisons, and antifreeze. But you also need to be aware of common food items, plants, and other substances that may be harmful to your pet. See common household hazards that may pose a danger to your pet.</p>

    <p><h3>CHECK THE LABEL</h3></p>
    <ul>
      <li>If your pet's skin or eyes are exposed to a toxic product (such as many cleaning products), check the product label for the instructions for people exposed to the product.</li>
      <li>If the label instructs you to wash your hands with soap and water if you're exposed, then wash your pet's skin with soap and water (don't get any into their eyes, mouth, or nose).</li>
      <li>If the label tells you to flush the skin or eyes with water, do this for your pet as soon as possible (if you can do it safely), and immediately call a veterinarian.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>GET HELP</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If you know your pet has swallowed or had contact with something that may be harmful, or if the animal is having seizures, losing consciousness, unconscious, or having difficulty breathing, call your veterinarian, emergency veterinary clinic, the Animal Poison Control Center hotline (888-426-4435), or Pet Poison Helpline (855-764-7661) immediately. A consultation fee may apply for hotline/helpline calls.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>If possible, have the following information available:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Species, breed, age, sex, weight, and number of animals involved.</li>
      <li>Symptoms.</li>
      <li>Name/description of the substance in question; amount the animal was exposed to; and how long it's been since your pet ate it or was exposed to it.</li>
      <li>Product container/packaging.</li>
      <li>Collect any material your pet may have vomited or chewed and place it in a plastic sealable bag to take with you when you bring your animal in for veterinary treatment.</li>
    </ul>
