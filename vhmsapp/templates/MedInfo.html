        <h2>Ensuring Pet Safety and Preparedness in Disasters and Emergencies</h2>
        <p>We always need to be prepared to take care of our animals, especially during disasters such as fire, flood, or other emergencies. In cases of fire or natural disasters, you need to be prepared in case your pet gets injured, lost, or has to be evacuated.</p>

          <li>A pre-determined plan in case of a disaster will help you remain calm and think clearly.</li>  
          <li>Remember to communicate and cooperate with all emergency personnel.</li>
          <li>If you must leave the premises let someone know where you are going and try to remain in contact with that person.</li>
